A preview at the various new parts I am designing for my delta 3D printer. Hopefully these will allow the printer to be much faster as they will be much lighter than the original metal parts that came with the anycubic linear kossle plus.

I tested the fit for the hotend part with the print head, but obviously the lower part will be machined aluminum and I have not got around to machining it yet. Also waiting on the rods for the linear bearings on the carriages to be able to test and fix the dimensions as necessary.

The hotend will be fully insulated (not shown here obviously) and hot swappable. The top receptacle is indented to receive a PCB with spring-loaded contacts which will press against a PCB lodged in the printhead. No tools necessary to disassemble, twist and pull it off. The extruder will also slide off the printhead to change/replace it. Full disassembly without tools.
