I have been working on a filament extruder (and print head platform) for my Anycubic Kossel linear plus 3D printer.

![extruder parts](/assets/images/extruder-parts.jpg)

The main differences with today's conventional extruders are
- this extruder will be much lighter as it will be remotely powered, but it will still be a direct extruder. Sounds like an oxymoron, but no, it isn't. That is why I call it a remote-direct hybrid extruder.
- it will not use a hobbed gear to push the filament
- it is easily swappable with no tools
- it can be disassembled without tools either
- it should allow very high filamnt pressure if needed
- have extremely high filament grip
- almost no backlash to minimize retraction
- except bearings and one metal part, entirely 3D-printable

Can't test yet as I have not finished designing the new printhead platform, and since this will be the most ridiculously over-engineered FDM delta printer I am also designing new arms and carriage. More about those as soon as I receive the missing parts.
