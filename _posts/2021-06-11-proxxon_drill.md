I broke my little proxxon drill.

sucks because that is a tool I use _all the time_

I particularly like that it runs so well: minimal runout for a hand tool, precise, a mandrel which can take very fine drill bits. (unlike the dremel, which totally sucks and wobbles like an old indian truck escaping pakistani soldiers)

So, I clearly had to make a new shell for it.

Yes, I know, it looks like it was designed in the 1960's by a soviet engineer. But it works and requires no screws for assembly, just slip on the 3 sleeves and everything is held tight.
