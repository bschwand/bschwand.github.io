Although software is immaterial, I am a software engineer who has always been fascinated by hardware. My favorite pastime as a kid was to disassemble machines and electronic devices to understand how they work. I love to fix things or make them better. I am fascinated by how computer can affect, create and control machines.

Therefore, you will find here not only musings about software but also about electro-mechanical hacking, 3D printer, CNC machining, welding, woodwork and generally hands-on dirty, greasy do not try this at home stuff.
